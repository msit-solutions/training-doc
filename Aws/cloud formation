AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and
 automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you

LAMBDA PRICING
  
With AWS Lambda, you pay only for what you use. 

You are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the duration, 
the time it takes for your code to execute.

The AWS Lambda free usage tier includes 1M free requests per
month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.

LAMBDA CONCURRENCY 

Concurrency is the number of requests that your function is
serving at any given time. 
When your function is invoked, Lambda allocates an instance of it to process the event. 
When the function code finishes running, it can handle another request.

steps for creation: 

>> Go to managament console of Aws
>> search for the lambda on search console
>> on lambda service console create a function.
>> select from 	Author from scratch option .
>> give the name of the function,select the run time as python.
>> select the permissions you can  select Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions. 
>> create the function .

* To invoke or test your function you need to create your event first.
>> got to test option in the below section need to create a event 
>> give the event name and save the function and test.
>> it will show the the code has been execution results succeded.
>> we can see the logs of code  in the cloud watch 
>> go to the cloud watch service.
>> go to log groups you will see the function of lambda and their logs.
 ( this logs has been showing beacuse of creation of the role while creation.)

* we can also make lambda function run using triggers ( api gateway)

[  API gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services
   ex: What is an example of an API gateway?
The popular example of API Gateway is Netflix API Gateway. 
The Netflix streaming services are available on hundreds of different kinds of devices such as televisions, set-top boxes, smartphones, tablets, etc. It attempts to provide a 
one-size-fits-all API for its streaming service.
>> on dashbord of the function you can see the add triggers option click on it
>> add the api-gateway 
>> create a new api 
>> on security click on the open option	and then click on add 
>> go to the configuration setting in that select triggers
>> we can see the api gateway  take the api endpoint 
>> copy the end point on the browser so that the function will be invoke the the result can be seen on browser.   

CLOUD FORMATION 

CLOUD FORMATION 

AWS CloudFormation simplifies provisioning and management on AWS. 
You can create templates for the service or application architectures 
you want and have AWS CloudFormation use those templates for quick and reliable provisioning of the services or applications (called “stacks”). 
You can also easily update or replicate the stacks as needed.

steps for creation:


>> Go to managament console of Aws
>> search for the cloud formation on search bar of  console
( creation of s3 bucket using cloud formation)
>> go to stack actions and select with new resources.
>> create a stack select a create template in designer 
>> In the Resource types select s3 and select bucket and  drag it on to the console 
   so that we can see the code has been auto generated.
>> click on top you can validate the code of bucket creation and also click on create stack
>> go with default in stack creation
>> create the stack name go with defaults
>> go to the s3 you will see the s3 bucket created  with customized name
